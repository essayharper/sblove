# SBLOVE - Direct Port of SMASHBELOW to LOVE

# Overview
SBLOVE is a direct port of the Pico-8 game "SMASHBELOW" created by cssboy (who is also my dad :-) ). This project aims to bring the pico8 game SMASHBELOW to the LOVE game development framework without introducing any enhancements or modifications to the original gameplay.


# Compatibility
Built using the LOVE framework, it should run smoothly on various platforms, providing accessibility to a broader audience.




# Credits
Original Game: SMASHBELOW by CSSBOY (also i was really young but i came up with the idea for the smashing mechanic)
